##Design

The general design of Check It Out! is loosely based off of popular message board
and forum apps such as reddit and 4chan. The app's function is intended to be
general and accessible for a multitude of audiences. 

The order of completion for the app's features revolves around the concept
of a minimum viable product. Features were completed starting from the most
basic and necessary, growing in complexity as time permitted.
